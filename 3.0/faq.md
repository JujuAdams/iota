### What platforms does iota support?

Probably everything! iota is pure GML and doesn't do anything hacky or weird. You might run into edge cases on platforms that I haven't tested; please [report any bugs](https://github.com/JujuAdams/Scribble/issues) if and when you find them.

&nbsp;

### How is iota licensed? Can I use it for commercial projects?

[iota is released under the MIT license](https://github.com/JujuAdams/iota/blob/master/LICENSE). This means you can use it for whatever purpose you want, including commercial projects. It'd mean a lot to me if you'd drop my name in your credits (Juju Adams) and/or say thanks, but you're under no obligation to do so.

&nbsp;

### I think you're missing a useful feature and I'd like you to implement it!

Great! Please make a [feature request](https://github.com/JujuAdams/iota/issues). Feature requests make iota a more fun tool to use and gives me something to think about when I'm bored on public transport.

&nbsp;

### I found a bug, and it both scares and mildly annoys me. What is the best way to get the problem solved?

Please make a [bug report](https://github.com/JujuAdams/iota/issues). Juju checks GitHub every day and bug fixes usually go out a couple days after that. You can also grab me on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/8krYCqr), but that's not a replacement for a nice clear bug report.

### Can I send you donations? Are you going to start a Patreon?

Thank you for wanting to show your appreciation - it really does mean a lot to me personally - but I'm fortunate enough to have a stable income from gamedev. I'm not looking to join Patreon as a creator at this moment in time. If you'd like to support my work then drop me a credit in your game and/or gimme a shout-out on the social media platform of your choice.
